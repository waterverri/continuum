- **Testing Philosophy**: Test behavior, not implementation details; focus on user interactions and business logic

## Architecture Overview

Continuum is a full-stack application for writers to manage story context with three main components:

**Frontend (React + Vite)**: Web dashboard deployed to Firebase Hosting. Handles user authentication and direct CRUD operations with Supabase using Row Level Security.

**Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)**: Serverless API deployed to Google Cloud Run. Reserved for complex server-side logic like the "Preset Engine" that dynamically assembles context from related documents.

**Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)**: Handles data persistence, user authentication, and authorization via Row Level Security policies.

## Data Access Patterns

**Frontend → Supabase Direct**: Standard CRUD operations use supabase-js client directly. Security enforced by RLS policies in migrations.

**Frontend → Backend API → Supabase**: Complex operations (like preset context generation) go through the backend API at `/api/presets/:id/context` endpoints.

## Key Data Model Concepts

**Project-Based Isolation**: All data is scoped to projects via `project_id` foreign keys. Users access projects through the `project_members` table with role-based permissions.

**Document Relationships**: The `documents` table supports three relationship patterns:
1. **Derivative**: Documents grouped by `group_id` with different `document_type` values
2. **Composite**: Dynamic documents with `is_composite=true` that resolve content from other documents via `components` JSONB field
3. **Event Links**: Many-to-many relationships between events and documents via `event_documents` join table

## Security & Authentication

- User identity managed by Supabase Auth
- Frontend uses supabase-js client with automatic JWT attachment
- Backend validates JWTs via Supabase `/auth/v1/user` endpoint
- Row Level Security policies enforce project-based data isolation
- Never commit secrets - use environment variables for API keys

## Current Implementation Status

**Completed**:

## Environment Setup

API requires `.env` with:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Dashboard requires `.env.local` with:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` 
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080` (for local development)

## Important Technical Details

- The `projectcontext.md` file contains comprehensive technical specifications and should be consulted for detailed implementation requirements
- Composite documents require server-side validation to prevent cyclic dependencies
- All database schema changes must be implemented as Supabase migrations
- **Component Architecture**: Follow the established patterns in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` for component composition, custom hooks, and state management
- **Styling Convention**: Use the CSS design system with variables, utilities, and component-specific styles
- **Code Organization**: Prefer small, focused components (under 200 lines) with single responsibilities over large monolithic files
- **Document Groups**: Support derivative relationships via `group_id` with dynamic type selection in composite documents
- **Group Reference Format**: Extended format `group:groupId:preferredType` enables specific document type selection within groups
- **Tagging Architecture**: Many-to-many relationship design with `tags`, `document_tags`, and `event_tags` tables for flexible content organization
- **Tag Management**: Project-scoped tags with color coding, comprehensive CRUD operations, and real-time UI updates
- **Tag Filtering**: Integrated tag-based filtering extends existing document search with multiple selection support
- **Testing Approach**: Focus on unit tests for business logic validation rather than complex integration testing with mocks
- **✅ COMPLETED: Events & Timeline System**: 
  - Comprehensive events management with hierarchical relationships (parent-child events)
  - Event-document associations for temporal organization of content
  - Document evolution tracking through event-specific versions (e.g., character development over time)
  - Timeline visualization with Gantt chart-style interface and list view
  - Advanced filtering system with event-based document filtering
  - Full backend API with 17 endpoints supporting CRUD operations, hierarchies, and document evolution
  - 6 specialized frontend components (EventManager, EventSelector, EventTimeline, etc.)
  - 119 comprehensive unit tests validating component behavior and API functionality
  - Database migrations with cycle detection to prevent circular event dependencies

## Frontend Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
The application follows a modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Pages**: Top-level route components (e.g., `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`)
- Orchestrate data loading and high-level state management
- Compose feature-specific components
- Handle routing and navigation

**Components Directory Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── DocumentForm.tsx           # Document creation/editing
│   ├── DocumentViewer.tsx          # Document display
│   ├── DocumentList.tsx            # Document lists with actions
│   ├── DocumentFilters.tsx         # Reusable filter components
│   ├── DocumentPickerModal.tsx     # Document selection modal
│   ├── ComponentKeyInputModal.tsx  # Component key input
│   ├── DerivativeModal.tsx         # Derivative document creation
│   ├── PresetPickerModal.tsx       # Preset creation flow
│   ├── GroupSwitcherModal.tsx      # Group type switching
│   ├── TagManager.tsx              # Tag CRUD operations
│   ├── TagSelector.tsx             # Document-tag associations
│   └── TagFilter.tsx               # Tag-based filtering
├── hooks/
│   ├── useProjectDetailState.ts    # Centralized state management
│   ├── useDocumentOperations.ts    # Business logic & API calls
│   └── useDocumentFilter.ts        # Filtering logic
└── styles/
    ├── variables.css               # Design system tokens
    ├── utilities.css               # Utility classes
    ├── layout.css                  # Layout and responsive styles
    └── components/                 # Component-specific styles
```

### CSS Architecture
**Design System Approach**:
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Utility classes for rapid development
- Component-scoped styles for encapsulation
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color scales

**Import Structure**: All component styles are imported through the main CSS file using `@import` statements for optimal bundling.

### Custom Hooks Pattern
**State Management**: `useProjectDetailState` centralizes all component state with typed actions
**Business Logic**: `useDocumentOperations` handles API calls and complex operations
**Feature Logic**: `useDocumentFilter` provides reusable filtering capabilities

## Development Guidelines for New Features

### Component Development
1. **Keep components focused**: Each component should have a single, clear responsibility
2. **Use custom hooks**: Extract complex state logic and API operations into custom hooks
3. **Follow naming conventions**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
4. **Leverage design system**: Use CSS variables, utilities, and established patterns
5. **Write tests**: Focus on unit tests for business logic and component behavior

### When Adding New Features
1. **Check existing patterns**: Look at `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` and its related components for established patterns
2. **Reuse components**: Before creating new components, check if existing ones can be extended or composed
3. **Use type safety**: Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined and used
4. **Follow CSS architecture**: Place styles in appropriate component-specific files using the design system
5. **Test thoroughly**: Run `npm run test:run` and `npm run build` before committing changes

## Recent Refactoring (2025)
The ProjectDetailPage underwent a major architectural refactoring that serves as the template for all future development:
- **Component Extraction**: Large monolithic components were broken down into focused, reusable components
- **Custom Hooks**: State management and business logic were extracted into custom hooks for better separation of concerns
- **CSS Modularization**: Styles were organized into a comprehensive design system with variables, utilities, and component-specific modules
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type definitions throughout
- **Testing Maintained**: All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regressions

This refactoring demonstrates the preferred architecture for complex UI components in this codebase.
