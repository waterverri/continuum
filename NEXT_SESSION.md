# Next Session Priorities

## Current Status: Comprehensive Tagging System COMPLETE âœ…

**Phase 6** (Comprehensive Tagging System) has been **successfully completed, tested, deployed, and documented**:

### Document Group Management System âœ…
- âœ… Derivative document creation with free-form types
- âœ… Group-based composite document selection  
- âœ… Advanced group type switching with modal UI
- âœ… Backend group APIs with intelligent resolution
- âœ… Extended reference format: `group:groupId:preferredType`

### Tagging System Implementation âœ…
- âœ… **Database Architecture:** Redesigned many-to-many tagging system with proper relationships
- âœ… **Backend API:** Full CRUD operations for tags with comprehensive validation
- âœ… **TagManager Modal:** Create, edit, delete project tags with 10-color picker
- âœ… **TagSelector Modal:** Intuitive document-tag association management  
- âœ… **Enhanced Filtering:** Tag-based filtering integrated with existing document search
- âœ… **Professional UI:** Color-coded tags with responsive, mobile-friendly design
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing:** 48 tests across frontend and backend with full coverage
- âœ… **Production Deployment:** All changes committed, built successfully, and documentation updated

## Phase 7: Events & Advanced Features

### Immediate Tasks (High Priority)

1. **Project Member Management (Quick Win - 1-2 hours)**
   - Create project settings page/modal in the frontend
   - Add UI to invite users by email to projects  
   - Add UI to manage existing member roles (owner, editor, viewer)
   - Add UI to remove members from projects
   - This uses existing `project_members` table and RLS policies

2. **Events System Foundation (3-4 hours)**
   - Extend `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` with Events section alongside Documents and Tags
   - Build basic CRUD for events (create, list, edit, delete)
   - Add timeline visualization for events using `time_start` and `time_end` fields
   - Leverage existing `events` and `event_documents` tables from initial schema

### Medium Priority

3. **Event-Document Linking (2-3 hours)**
   - Build UI to link events to relevant documents via existing `event_documents` table
   - Add "Related Events" section to document viewer
   - Add "Related Documents" section to event viewer

4. **Event Tagging Integration (1-2 hours)**
   - Extend existing TagSelector to support events using `event_tags` table
   - Add event filtering by tags using existing TagFilter component
   - Integrate with existing tag management system

### Future Sessions

5. **Phase 8: Preset Engine (Major Feature)**
   - Build the core context generation system
   - Create preset rule builder UI for complex filtering with tag support
   - Enhance `GET /presets/:id/context` endpoint with advanced rule processing
   - This is the main value proposition of Continuum - dynamic context assembly

## Technical Notes

- âœ… **Complete Database Schema:** All core tables implemented with proper relationships
- âœ… **Tagging Infrastructure:** `tags`, `document_tags`, and `event_tags` tables with RLS policies
- âœ… **Group System:** Fully operational with derivative document management
- âœ… **Document Resolution:** Supports both individual documents and group references  
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing:** Robust test suite with 48+ tests covering core functionality
- **Next Focus:** Events UI/UX to complete organizational foundation before Preset Engine

## Recent Achievements

**Document Groups & Tagging** - Users can now:
- Create derivative documents (summaries, translations, etc.) from any source
- Use groups in composite documents with `{{group:groupId:type}}` syntax  
- Switch between different document types within groups dynamically
- **Create and manage color-coded tags** for organizing documents
- **Filter documents by tags** with intuitive multi-select interface
- **Associate tags with documents** through professional modal interfaces  
- Benefit from intelligent representative document selection
- Experience professional modal-based interfaces throughout

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Users can create and manage document groups with multiple types/versions
- âœ… Users can build composite documents using both individual docs and groups
- âœ… Users can switch document types within groups without losing configuration
- âœ… **Users can tag and filter their content effectively with color-coded organization**
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can collaborate on projects with proper role management
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can organize story events on a timeline
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can link events to relevant documents for context
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can tag events and use comprehensive filtering across all content

**Current Priority:** Move to Events & Timeline system to complete the organizational foundation before building the advanced Preset Engine that delivers Continuum's core value proposition.
