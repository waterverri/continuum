# Next Session Priorities

## Current Status: Document Group Management System COMPLETE âœ…

**Phase 5** (Document Group Management System) has been **successfully completed, tested, deployed, and documented**:
- âœ… Derivative document creation with free-form types
- âœ… Group-based composite document selection  
- âœ… Advanced group type switching with modal UI
- âœ… Backend group APIs with intelligent resolution
- âœ… Extended reference format: `group:groupId:preferredType`
- âœ… Complete test coverage and production deployment
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation updates

## Phase 6: Events & Tagging System

### Immediate Tasks (High Priority)

1. **Project Member Management (Quick Win - 1-2 hours)**
   - Create project settings page/modal in the frontend
   - Add UI to invite users by email to projects  
   - Add UI to manage existing member roles (owner, editor, viewer)
   - Add UI to remove members from projects
   - This uses existing `project_members` table and RLS policies

2. **Events System Foundation (3-4 hours)**
   - Create migration `0005_add_event_documents_table.sql` for the `event_documents` join table
   - Extend `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` with Events section alongside Documents
   - Build basic CRUD for events (create, list, edit, delete)
   - Add timeline visualization for events using `time_start` and `time_end` fields

### Medium Priority

3. **Event-Document Linking (2-3 hours)**
   - Build UI to link events to relevant documents via `event_documents` table
   - Add "Related Events" section to document viewer
   - Add "Related Documents" section to event viewer

4. **Tagging System (2-3 hours)**
   - Build tag management UI for both documents and events
   - Add tag filtering/search capabilities
   - Use existing `tags` table with key-value pairs

### Future Sessions

5. **Phase 7: Preset Engine (Major Feature)**
   - Build the core context generation system
   - Create preset rule builder UI for complex filtering
   - Enhance `GET /presets/:id/context` endpoint with advanced rule processing
   - This is the main value proposition of Continuum - dynamic context assembly

## Technical Notes

- All database tables already exist per `0001_initial_schema.sql`
- Only missing the `event_documents` join table (simple migration)
- RLS policies already cover events and tags
- **Group system is fully operational** - documents can now be organized in derivative groups
- Document resolution engine supports both individual documents and group references
- Focus on UI/UX since backend foundation and group management are solid

## Recent Achievements

**Document Groups** - Users can now:
- Create derivative documents (summaries, translations, etc.) from any source
- Use groups in composite documents with `{{group:groupId:type}}` syntax  
- Switch between different document types within groups dynamically
- Benefit from intelligent representative document selection
- Experience professional modal-based interfaces throughout

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Users can create and manage document groups with multiple types/versions
- âœ… Users can build composite documents using both individual docs and groups
- âœ… Users can switch document types within groups without losing configuration
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can collaborate on projects with proper role management
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can organize story events on a timeline
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can link events to relevant documents for context
- ðŸŽ¯ Users can tag and filter their content effectively

**Current Priority:** Move to Events & Timeline system to complete the organizational foundation before building the advanced Preset Engine that delivers Continuum's core value proposition.
